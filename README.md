java-multithreading

As we know that Multithreading in Java is a very important topic. Multithreading means doing things simultaneously, in parallel. In Java, concurrency is done with threads. Threads are units of code that can be executed at the same time. They are sometimes called lightweight processes, although, in fact, a thread is executed within a process (and every process has, at least, one thread, the main thread).

The source code examples from this up-to-date tutorial are developed using JDK 8 or later (Lambda expressions, functional interfaces etc) and well tested on our local development environment.

In this tutorial, we will learn low-level APIs that have been part of the Java platform from the very beginning. These APIs are adequate for very basic tasks. In Java Concurrency Tutorial, we will learn high-level concurrency features introduced with version 5.0 of the Java platform. Java provides multithreading support with the Thread class and an application can create multiple threads executing concurrently.
>> How to Create and Start a Thread in Java
This is the first article of this tutorial, in this article, we will learn how to create and run a thread in a Java application. Java provides two ways to create a thread programmatically. Implementing the Runnable interface and extending the Thread class.
>> Java Thread Sleep Example
In this article, we will learn how to pause the execution of a current thread. Java Thread class provides sleep method, which can be used to pause the execution of a current thread. We will use Thread sleep extensively in future posts, so itâ€™s good to know how it works and is it accurate or not?.
